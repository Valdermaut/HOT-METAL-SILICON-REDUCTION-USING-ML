# MODEL WISE IMPORTANT PARAMETERS

Summary of Findings

a) Key observations
Following were the conclusions derived from the assessment of results and are found to be consistent with the business objectives due to the reasons mentioned.

1) Availability and Si level are clearly seen to have an inverse relationship from Availability-Si Trend. Hence availability is key focus area.

2) Each model has provided its own set of important parameters and nearly all have a few in common such as HM_TEMP, CORR_COKE_RATE, SLAG_RATE and SIN_CAO_SIO2. These findings are consistent with the current knowledge and known to be used as levers to control Si directly/indirectly. This also indicated that the models are fairly reliable in their outcomes.

3) Ranges of important parameters are also consistent with the common knowledge. Ranges were verified as per the current knowledge of direct/inverse relationship. Analysis helped to pinpoint the range of the individual parameters with respect to Low/High Silicon.

4) Other important parameters can be considered as the new findings.

a) Approved model

-â€‹ All 3 models were approved. b) Way forward

- Analysis was found to be relevant and outcome of models against testing data was also found to be consistent. The offline models should be translated into an online prediction system which can be accessed directly by the end users. This will be the scope of the subsequent project.
